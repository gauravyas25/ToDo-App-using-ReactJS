create a folder named "ToDo" or etc.
open the folder in terminal and run these commands
   1. npm create vite@latest
   2. npm install
   3. npm run dev

I have used three additional commands to install icons and the progressbar
   1. npm install @mui/icons-material
   2. npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
   3. npm install react-circular-progressbar
